This repo is suppose to make it easy for me to gather all available information on a new stock I am investigating, combining the power of finreddit, grabbing investor docs via cad_tickers and grabbing financial ratios that I maintain (likely 3 months behind).


### Todo

Add papermill to generate juypter notebooks based on props.
